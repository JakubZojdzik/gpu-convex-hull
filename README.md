# Parallel Convex Hull Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project compares several convex hull algorithms executed on both CPU (single-threaded) and GPU (parallel, CUDA-based).  
The goal is to evaluate their performance on large point sets distributed in the plane.

## Problem Description

Given a set \( P \) of points in the two-dimensional Cartesian plane, the task is to find the smallest convex set containing all points from \( P \).

Formally, the problem reduces to finding a subset \( P' \subseteq P \) such that:
- the polygon formed by points in \( P' \) is convex,
- all points from \( P \) lie inside or on the boundary of this polygon.

This polygon is known as the **convex hull**.

## Input Data

Point sets used for evaluation are generated by uniform sampling from the unit disk in the XY plane.

Planned dataset sizes include:
- \(10^4\)
- \(10^5\)
- \(10^6\)
- \(10^7\)

The final dataset sizes may be adjusted based on performance results.

The list of GPU algorithms may be modified if implementation constraints arise.

## Evaluation Methodology

Algorithms are compared based on their average execution time.

- Data transfer time between CPU and GPU is excluded.
- The number of executions is chosen dynamically depending on runtime to ensure stable measurements.

## Visualization

To verify correctness, visualizations are generated presenting:
- the input point set,
- the resulting convex hull.
